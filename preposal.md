# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

# I want to keep it simple, but I also want it to be a longer project. I like foreign languages so I would like to incorporate
# that aspect into this project. Every country has their own version of the "Rock, paper, scissors" game. I want to make a program
# where the user can choose which version of the game they would like to play and allowing the program to randomly choose
# an option to go against the user.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

# N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

# N/A
